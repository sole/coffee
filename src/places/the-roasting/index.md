Flat white isn't very good here, as a) the owners are Italian and b) seem to cater to Italians, judging by the copious amounts of spoken Italian you can hear on this cafe. So when I come here I order a **double espresso**, and occassionally one of their sweet treats--their chocolate cannoli are so yummy they'll make you feel guilty and happy in equal doses #notguiltyactually.

Wi-fi it's also available and works beautifully, although I haven't tried to use videoconference or anything like that there. There are lots of power sockets in the table. The seating is not the most comfortable if you're in the benches, better try to get a chair instead.

Decoration is minimal and airy, very bright. When it's sunny it gets hot inside like a conservatory--I love it! They also have lots of architecture, furniture and fashion magazines to peruse. It's a nice place to practice your Italian listening skills!
