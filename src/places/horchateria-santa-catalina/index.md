Don't delude yourself: you don't come here for a coffee, but for the horchata. And the fartons. But if you must, to save yourself from pain, either...

* have the iced coffee with icecream (blanco y negro con leche merengada)
* or have a cortado, and possibly add sugar to counteract the sourness of the beans

Café con leche ("latte") might have too hot milk, and also have too much milk as well.

But honestly, focus on the horchata instead.
