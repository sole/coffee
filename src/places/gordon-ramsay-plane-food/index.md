The food is decent (specially for airport food standards), but the coffee is really mediocre. It lacks flavour, the cup is too big for a flat white, the bubbles in the foam are too big, the presentation is sad, and very importantly, it's too hot (which probably kills any possible distinctiveness their stale tasting beans might have had).

Sadly the bar for coffee in this airport is so low it's hard to choose a 'best from the really bad' contender... **cries unconsolably in a corner**.
