This place used to be called 'Sense Appeal' and it was my favourite morning meeting spot each time we visited Toronto. Then last March I learned it had been renamed to this uninteresting name, and it was indeed a bit less interesting than the last time I visited. Now I just learned it is permanently closed! I guess they closed it before settling for an even more boring new name.

It used to serve terrific flat whites when it was still Sense Appeal. The staff were also more relaxed. It was good to sit on the window bench and look at passers-by.
