Very nice flat white.

I ordered my coffee to go, so I can't comment on how good the space is for long sittings, but it seemed very welcoming and with plenty of room, and there were lots of people seemingly having meetings and doing businessy stuff, so I'll assume it's not an unlikely place to work from.

Staff were chill and nice.
