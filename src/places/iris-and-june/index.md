This place is always full of 'creatives' having meetings. It feels very airy and industrial.

The flat whites are extremely nice here, and they also offer filter and V60, but I haven't tried them. You can buy beans, from Ozone coffee roasters. Food is good as well, but be warned that it goes away quickly (when it's gone, it's gone).

Expect queues at peak times, as this place is popular with the creatives!

Week-ends are way quieter and more enjoyable. And now they are open on Sundays too. Yay!
