We had double espressos - nicely sour, but not bitter, and at the right temperature, plus some delicious pastries the waiter recommended us.

We didn't feel Italian enough to have them by the bar, so we sat at a table instead. It was nice and sunny in that morning and it was a great way to start the day.

The place is lovely and the waiters were not fussed at all about us not speaking a very great Italian.
