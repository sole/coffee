This is a lovely cosy caf√© with *plenty* of Mediterranean inspiration (I know, I know, such a terrible pun).

I had a smooth flat white. It was slightly too milky and the flavour was diluted in the big cup, but other than that it was really nice. The atmosphere of the place got me slightly confused as it sort of brought me back to my childhood, what with the rustic chairs and the mellow, soft lighting, but I don't remember drinking flat whites back then!

Food looked great. I should go back some day. Unfortunately they close at week-ends!
