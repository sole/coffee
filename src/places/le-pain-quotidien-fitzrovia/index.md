This is where you grab a coffee when all other places are closed, as it's just standard franchise coffee quality (read: mediocre).

Food wise, pretty much all the take-away pastries and cookies are excessively sweet. Probably a better value if sitting in and ordering cooked food, but I haven't done it at this franchise.
