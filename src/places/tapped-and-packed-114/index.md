Their flat whites are pretty good (although a touch too hot to handle).

I've only been here to grab coffee to go, so I'm not really sure how good it is to work from here.

My only complaint is that staff can be a bit stiff and make you feel like "eeeeh". One time I came in two minutes (two! minutes!) before their opening time, and they didn't even bother asking me to wait two minutes until whatever magic event happened in the cosmos and they could make me a coffee, which was super ridiculous. Now I try to come here only if absolutely necessary.
