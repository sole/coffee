Now in their new location (they used to be in an older building in Charlotte Street), they keep delivering super strong flat whites. It feels like it has three or four shots of espresso instead of the customary two. I find it slightly overpowering, and always forget to ask for "less strength", so I visit quite occassionally.

The snacks and pastries aren't spectacular, but edible.
