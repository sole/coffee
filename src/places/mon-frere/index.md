I had an OK iced coffee (their 'freddo').

It was mostly fine, except for the fact that most of the people sitting outside were smoking, and also some people inside, so it was really not cool and I didn't stay for long.

If you don't mind the smoke, it seemed like an OK place to stay for a while and work from, although I don't recall if it had wi-fi or not.
