Two of my favourite things together: coffee and coconuts!

This place was unbelievably hot, as apparently hot weather had taken all amsterdamers by surprise. We braved it and had lots of yummy coconut-based food here. It was glorious.

My coffee was in a quite sweet smoothie so I've no idea how the coffee actually tasted like, but the food was really fresh and great.

The space is really its own thing. Well worth a visit.
