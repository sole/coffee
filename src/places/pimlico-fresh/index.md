Let's be honest, you don't come here for the coffee. You come here for the food! But the coffee is good as well.

The flat white is pretty decent. Food wise, pretty much everything is interesting, and if you're feeling really brave, try the french toast. Their spirulina juice is quite refreshing as well.

This place gets very, very busy during peak times (often lunch), and specially on week-ends. Get ready to share a table with (uuuh!) strangers. If they see you with a laptop during busy times you might be told off. Please don't. Eat your food and go away.
