Very reliable flat white. Always full bodied, and the right temperature. Perfect to grab and stroll around Soho. I've only sat on the bench outside, as it's always full! But it's a nice place to practice the art of people watching, specially on those rare sunny days.

No idea how it is to work from here, whether it has wi-fi, how the food is, etc... I only come here for the coffee!
