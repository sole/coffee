We ordered two iced matcha lattes that took forever to reach our table, for some strange reason as the place wasn't even that busy.

The space is beautiful, and there's plenty of natural food to consume or buy. Looks like a nice place to work from, but not sure about wi-fi or power sockets. Although there were a few people with their laptops when we visited...
