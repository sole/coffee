I had a 'thing' that looked like a distant relative of flat whites, but didn't taste like one. It was kind of milky, but not very coffeey like. Strange.

All in all, it was quite a bizarre experience.

The person on the counter was super stiff. Maybe he was new?

There was a member of staff who seemed to have been running a marathon of sorts in the store room, and was so hot he was very keen on opening all the freaking windows and doors in the space. These open to the very cold and shady Fitzroy Place and create an awful draught. I moved away from the table I was on, and changed to a corner and the guy asked me 'if it was fine' to open the window, *after opening it*. Huh... I told him it was quite chilly already, and he fortunately repented.

After that, a bunch of people with bulky luggage got into the shop and started deploying their stuff around, not minding at all if somebody else stumbled upon their tripods and cables and fell. They were photographers ready to do a photoshoot of... the food in the place. In the meantime, their -I guess- PR person took pictures of the photographers taking pictures. It was all very meta.

Fortunately Marathon Guy was focused on pleasing the photographers instead of opening more windows, and let me be and do my own thing.

I came on a later occasion on a somewhat late Friday evening and it was quieter and nice. Perhaps not the place to go have coffee. Have some food instead.
