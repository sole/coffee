We had two very good flat whites on a busy Sunday afternoon.

This is the new premises for the shop that was closer to Marylebone high street before. There seems to be a bit more space than in the tiny store from before, but the seating now is a tad uncomfortable. We didn't stay for long--we just drank our coffees and left.
