Lovely place to get a treat. We used it as our 'farewell' to Bologna, lest we become addicted to it on the first day and insist on coming back every single day of our stay.

We also finally tried the famous torta di riso here! At last! and it was every bit as great as it had been described to us.

It is a very fancy and also casual place, but don't expect this to be a great place to work from. More like a place to have a bite and enjoy the terrace in the sun.
