Flat whites here are consistently nice. I also like the granola for breakfast (although I sit in for that). In very busy times you might need to share a table with someone. They also disable the wi-fi at those times. It's sometime in the morning, but I can't tell for sure because I never used the wi-fi. I have worked for a while here, but nothing too long.

The space is pretty, airy, and has lots of artsy stuff in the walls, often for sale.

Ordering coffee for take-away can be a bit of an odissey as they seem to prioritise eat-in customers over take-away, and if they have lots of backlog it can easily take 10+ minutes of waiting until you finally get your coffee.
