I really liked this place, despite its extremely minimal (spartan?) decoration with a 70s vibe (those tables!). I got a very strong and bodied flat white, and a cookie which wasn't extremely sweet.

Staff was nice. It was fun to witness the locals come, drink their coffee really quickly and go, while I was all slow and sleepy first thing in the morning.

I reckon this could be a nice place to work for a while, but I haven't seen it when it's busy.
