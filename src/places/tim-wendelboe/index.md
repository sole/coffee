We grabbed some cold brew coffee to go. It was pretty mellow and subtle, but you could taste the flavour there.

The place was absolutely brimming with people (perhaps because it was one of those rare sunny days in Oslo) so it took us a while to work through the queue. Not the quietest of places, and it is not like it's on Central Oslo anyway. I will just attribute it to the proximity to a park.
