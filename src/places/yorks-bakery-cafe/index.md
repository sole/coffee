I had a flat white and a piece of cake, which turned out to be slightly dry as they store it on the open. The flat white was quite respectable.

Wi-fi worked flawlessly (I asked the waitress for the password), although the table I was using wasn't perfectly smooth and it was all a bit wobbly. There were plenty of other people around working on their laptops, so I guess it's a place for the local creative scene 8-)

Staff were wonderfully chill and nice.
