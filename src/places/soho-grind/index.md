Found this place accidentally while crisscrossing streets after shopping. It serves a really strong flat white at the right temperature, with plenty of aroma still.

Their food snacks are decent.

In theory they also serve cocktails, but I've never tried those.

Downstairs looks good and cosy although it will eventually result in you getting a headache as the music is extremely loud. Better to stay on the ground floor.
