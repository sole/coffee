Nice views of the station and the departures/arrival panel if you're sitting by the balcony stools.

The coffee... we'd better not talk about it or about the long, stressful wait to get it once you've paid. The saddest thing might be that this is possibly the best place to get coffee in the station. Ahhhghhh...!
