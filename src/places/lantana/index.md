I really want to love this place, but it's always so full that I get super stressed.

Which is a pity, because the coffee is consistently good. But you either get in first thing in the morning, or you have to queue. Granted, the food is delicious. Decisions, decisions.

If you come during the week, they open their take-away side, so it's less stressful to get a take-away coffee.

They do provide decent wi-fi (I guess because there's absolutely zero reception inside the building), but with the cafe being so busy, you'd be a terrible person if you stayed there all day with your laptop.
