I'm never quite sure what a visit to this place will produce. They used to be really bad at service, but they seem to have got a little bit better lately. When they do serve you before you give up on them, it is a quite good flat white.

They also seem to do that thing where they prioritise eat-in customers, and you are queueing in the way between the coffee machine and the tables, so it can get a bit stressful to wait for your take-away coffee if it's a busy time.
