Very nice flat white. I also had a muffin which was very good too.

I had my coffee to take away, so I can't tell much about the qualities of the space if staying-in, but it always looks to me like a place one could work from, if only for a bit.

The other thing that is very nice about this shop is that it helps homeless people in the area. So having your coffee with them is a charitable act.
