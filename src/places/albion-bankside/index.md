I actually haven't ordered a coffee yet, but I had a mint tea as my stomach was very upset at me. It was a very flavourful and fresh tea, and after that my stomach was happy again.

Staff were acting awkwardly, I'm not sure if they wanted us to have food, or if they didn't expect people to not to have dinner at that time, or who knows what, but they seemed to be having a difficult time putting one and one together. Or perhaps they were just new. I don't know, but they didn't make me feel very comfortable.
