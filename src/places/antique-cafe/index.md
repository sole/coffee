I was very excited at the prospect of a 'vintage retro chic' café in Valencia where they served cute cakes and delicious coffee, but it looked more promising in the pictures than it actually was.

I had a latte and a slice of cake. The first wasn't particularly memorable, and the cake was a touch too sweet--you could barely make out the flavour underneath.

The place was slightly vintage but not quite enough, the plastic mantelpieces hinting at some stickiness. Sure enough, it was a very quiet space at that time. Not quite sure how it holds at popular times, but it was hidden enough that it might always stay quiet. Who knows!
