We had a filter coffee and a V60... both of which were served in wine-style glasses, to our surprise. The coffee had a pleasant aroma and we could feel the slight difference between the two brewing methods, which was interesting to our not-too-much-into-coffee-snobbery friend.

I'm quite pleased we found this decent coffee shop in the city. They also had working wi-fi. Staff was very nice and accommodating. Tables seem OK to work from, although given the 'rustic' furniture I'm not sure for how long can one resist sitting on them.
