My favourite caf√© in the area, it's got so many great things to like!

The flat whites are consistently great--not too strong, but super tasty, including decafs. Their filter coffee is very nice as well. And if you're not into coffee per se, they can also make you a matcha flat whites.

The food is also great. They have open sandwiches and the one with avocado and bacon is really yummy. Their sweets are fantastic as well, and their granola is fresh and fulfilling.

The space is lovely: bright and airy, decorated with changing art exhibitions, and with a quieter basement which is great for meetings or working. Music is often interesting as well.

Staff are always very chill and accommodating.

Week-ends are the best, as it's still got a nice vibe but it's not ultra busy.

The only 'bad thing', which might not be a bad thing after all, is that not only they do not offer wi-fi, but also cell reception is quite spotty, so even tethering to your phone is complicated if you're not sitting close to the window.
