Just a tad above the usual Starbucks coffee, but without the 'comfort', and with lots of fuss. I had a flat white which was quite average and took a lot of ceremony to obtain (queue here, queue there, wait for the coffee in another counter, etc...).

Much ado about nothing, as they'd say. Seems like a place where one could get some work done if you don't mind all the fuss.
