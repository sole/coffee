This is a truly beautiful gem of a caf√©. Not only do they make a solid flat white with plenty of flavour, and staff are incredibly welcoming, but the space is absolutely gorgeous.

There's the ground floor which satisfies all the requirements of a hip coffee shop, plus a first floor which is a bit quieter, and the best of all, their **secret garden** on the back of the first floor. A peaceful yard between buildings in which to enjoy some sun (when it shines...) and nicely decorated with quirky pots and real tomato plants, amongst others. Very urban chic (whatever that means, I just made it up).

I am sad I found about the garden too late this year, but I will totally be coming back to it when it gets hot again next year!
