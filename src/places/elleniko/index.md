I really wanted to try the famous 'Greek coffee', so what better than going to a "Greek café"?

The waiter was a bit puzzled that I insisted on having a Greek coffee, and tried to warn me that it was "different" in every possible way he could think of, but I was not deterred.

The presentation was beautiful and I could even imagine taking part in some kind of ancient coffee ritual, but I sort of regretted my adventurous ways shortly after taking the first sip. It was certainly as the waiter described it: boiled coffee. All the flavours had been killed and only a sort of earthy flavour remained. It was like licking a garden spade, I guess (I've never licked any garden utensil for what is worth).

Still, I did finish it. "Maybe you eventually end up liking this if you try hard enough", I thought. "Maybe it's an acquired taste". So I hoped I could acquire it with just one cup of Greek coffee, but it didn't quite work. I didn't have another one during the time I spent in Greece.

The place is beautiful though, full of old pictures of Thessaloniki and other old stuff and memorabilia. I went on the afternoon and it was really quiet so that would be a good time to work there. Not sure about wi-fi or power sockets.
