I really like the coffee here. I've had both flat whites and filter coffee (sometimes the two in the same visit--they are *that* good!). The flat white is creamy and flavourful, the filter is delicate and full of aroma.

The food is very good as well, perhaps a bit on the pricey side, but it's Shoreditch after all. It's all "Australian inspired" and super filling and soul nurturing.

The only issue with this place is it's so good it's popular, so it can be a bit stressful to get a space, specially if you're a "big group" (i.e. more than two people). We once sat on the bar and it was by far my favourite seat.

Maybe a good place to work from, but possibly only off-peak hours, as it seems to always be quite busy.
