I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness and niceness of the staff at this Notes branch. Even if it was "late" and they were shifting to serve dinner, the waitress didn't mind and still showed me what was still available to snack, even if it had been put away to show the 'dinner delicacies'.

I had a decaf flat white, which although less strong than normal coffee, still had a good body and flavour.

My only objection was the music was extremely loud, and both me and my friend ended with a sore throat as we had to keep yelling at each other. Ahhh! I want to think this was because it was 'dinner time'. Or something. Otherwise I cannot possibly see this as a place to work from, unless you're into loud music somebody else chooses for you. But tables looked comfortable enough for using a laptop on them.
