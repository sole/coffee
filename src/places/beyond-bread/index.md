I wanted a coffee and a quick bite, but I didn't want to do the Lantana queue.

I didn't have many expectations, but the flat white was surprisingly good, same as the gluten free cake. It was hard to tell it wasn't real flour.

The place is also really pretty.

Work wise I guess you could use your laptop here, but I don't remember there being a wi-fi network, and the place is literally a black spot of zero network reception, so forget about tethering.
