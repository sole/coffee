I had a quite decent flat white, if only a little bit on the weak side. That was fine. But the rest...! 

I had been to other Workshop branches before, and this was, overall, a very puzzling experience.

First, there didn't seem to be a clear queue. More like two. But not obvious what for, or in which order they would go. People were queueing in any of them interchangeably. Hard to deduct the rules of the game. And staff didn't seem very inclined to take customers out of their confusion. Eventually I sort of "place my order" to the queue on the right. The person behind the counter nods and I... move to the queue to the left?

On the left, I am about to... pay? and the person on the till asks me what am I going to have. Why did I queue for ordering on the other side when a) I had to repeat it again and b) my coffee is not even here yet, I wondered? Still, I was determined to try out this branch. So I repeat my order, and pay, and sit.

I sat on the little 'nook' as they describe it, on the back of their shop. And wait.

And wait. And wait. A good 15 minutes. I was so tempted to leave without the coffee.

And it's not like they were ultra busy. I've been to places which were busier and got a coffee in my hands in a matter of minutes, not *quarters* of an hour.

So there I am sitting in their 'eclectic' chair, my knees fighting with the low table for some sort of comfort or space, or just fighting for the sake of fighting because I'm bored, and all while being subjected to the mad laughter of a woman in a group that was determined to make it very clear that she found everything hilarious. Point taken, lady, we all heard you the first time! Eventually the coffee arrives and I just look at it for a second, check the foam, etc, it all looks fine, I just drank it and left.

If you're extremely small you might find it enticing to sit on this cafe and work using the low tables. Either that or put the laptop in your lap and let your knees "rest" against the table. I don't think it's very comfortable, not for having coffee, neither for working from there. Too much leaning required. But hey, maybe I just didn't get the point.

I haven't been back :-(
