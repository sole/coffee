My favourite coffee place in the area.

The flat whites are super, the cardamom rolls are something out of this world, and the living room-like space at the end is just the best place to hide.

I also like their open sandwiches--the halloumi and avocado one was delicious.

Only pity is staff occassionally act as if they are making you a favour, which is kinda weird.
