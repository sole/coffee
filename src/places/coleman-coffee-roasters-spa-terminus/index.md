Get a pastry on the Little Bread Pedlar, then turn around and queue to get a coffee to go on this small shared space in one of the arches of the Spa Terminus market. Then get out the arch and enjoy it on the street as there's just no space to have it inside. But oh, such a good combination.

Great flat white with beautiful aroma, and delicious cinnamon rolls from the bakery. Perfect.

Open on Saturday mornings, and it's just impossible to resist the aromas coming out of this arches as you walk nearby. Obey your senses.
