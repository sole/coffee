Admittedly not the best flat white you've ever had, BUT the space is super convenient to work on, and somehow it's still easy to find a seat even if it's very busy. Plus, there are lots of power sockets.

Wi-Fi can be spotty at times.

Their food is pretty decent, and they have quite imaginative desserts. Plus the very numerous staff are always very nice to deal with.
