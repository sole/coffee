I mostly come here to buy beans, as the space is so popular it's impossible to find a seat, and even if you found one, it's so busy you can't enjoy being here. Their flat white is superb, and I also like the iced lattes. But seriously, the best is the beans selection and buying by the weight, so you can taste different options.
