You don't come here for the coffee, but if you must, their coffee is kinda-OK.

Flat whites are quite milky, served in clear glasses. They remind me of the kind of coffee a grandma would prepare for a young child: very mellow and smooth!

Brunches are nice here. If you can sit on the bar, you can see the cocktail making. Staff are very nice.
