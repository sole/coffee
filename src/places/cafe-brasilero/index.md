I was excited at the idea of having some decent coffee in Uruguay, but again I got a big disappointment as this place delivered an iced coffee with the same terrible metallic after-taste that I had experienced on all the other places in Montevideo already.

Pity because the decor was everything I could possibly expect from a South American café.
