This is the café on the ground floor of the Mozilla office building, so it's very convenient if it's raining, and we want to get a professional-barista-made flat white but we don't want to use an umbrella or get wet.

They often have art hanging on the (brick) walls. The place is slightly dark which is really good if you are using a laptop with a shiny display (so no reflection on your screen). The music can be quite good sometimes.

Staff are very nice.

Coffee quality is not very consistent. I've had great and average flat whites; it depends on the person making it. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks very yummy.

Wifi is available but limited to about one hour (even if the login screen says two hours or something like that). You have to register. Boo! Speed is quite consistent, but not spectacular.

It can get quite busy at peak times (specially lunch) but it's decently quiet past 14h. They close at about 19h.
