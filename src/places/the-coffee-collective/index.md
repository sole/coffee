Minimal and stylish, serving a pretty good flat white. Sligthly milder than I expected it, but very decent.

Staff were very nice and welcoming, really relaxed.

This caf√© is inside a sort of deli-market, and there are lots of excellent chocolate sellers nearby, so if you are looking for some gifts to bring home, those are good resources ;-)

I didn't try the other food stalls in the market, but they looked very good as well.
