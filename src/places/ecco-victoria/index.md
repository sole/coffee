Either my tastes have changed, or the coffee I got after many many years of not visiting this place was particularly average. I was feeling quite childish so I ordered a cappuccino *way* past 14h. It was too hot, almost verging on being burnt. The pizza lacked quite a lot of substance (or toppings), but I guess for the price you can't ask for more.
